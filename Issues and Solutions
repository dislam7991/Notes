ISSUES

<h2>  ISSUE 1  </h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Could not use GitHub extension in VS Code on my personal laptop like I could on my work laptop (wasn't synced to same repository, etc)
      -> tried installing GitHub extension
      -> tried pulling from GitHub repository
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>  Insights  </h2>
-> Personal laptop VSCode was pointing to a different repository (wrong repos.)
-> Tried deleting current remote, adding "webdev" remote, and pulling changes, but didn't work.
  -> Couldn't authenticate on personal laptop without a public key.
** Solution **
Create and Add Multiple SSH keys, one for each device (personal, work laptops).
  pros: can manage, and limit access for each device with an SSH key, if needed. GitHub lets you add multiple keys.
-> Generate keys and add to GitHub account, and store passkeys/passphrases in BitWarden (pw manager)

<h2> ISSUE 2 </h2>
Could not do in VS Code Powershell terminal.
  -> terminated session, launched powershell in admin mode, located my SSH key i generated, 
  -> added SSH Key to my 'ssh-agent' (openssl)
  -> added SSH Key to my GitHub account

-> Success
